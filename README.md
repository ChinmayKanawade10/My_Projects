# üìÇ Project Repository

This repository contains distinct projects related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI-driven applications. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## ü§ñ AutoML System for Supervised Learning : https://github.com/ChinmayKanawade10/My_Projects/tree/main/AutoML

An Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) system designed for supervised learning tasks, with a focus on transparency and interpretability. It automates key stages of the ML pipeline, including:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection.
- **Model Selection:** Supports Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Uses Bayesian Optimization for fine-tuning.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrates SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

## üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Ensemble Model : https://github.com/ChinmayKanawade10/My_Projects/tree/main/BrainTumorClassification

A deep learning-based approach for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. It employs an ensemble of InceptionV3, DenseNet, and VGG16 models to improve classification accuracy. Key components include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Skull stripping, cropping, CLAHE, and normalization.
- **Model Training:** Individual models are trained separately and then combined.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Uses weighted averaging to improve performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed with accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## ‚öõÔ∏è PhysicsBot ‚Äì AI Chatbot for Physics Q&A : https://github.com/ChinmayKanawade10/My_Projects/tree/main/PhysicsBot

An AI chatbot built to answer physics-related questions based on *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*. It processes the book, stores vectorized data in an open-source vector database, and generates responses using an NLP model. Key features include:
- **Text Processing:** Extracts and cleans text from the book.
- **Vector Storage:** Converts text into embeddings and stores them efficiently.
- **LLM-Based Responses:** Uses a lightweight NLP model to generate answers.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieves the most relevant sections based on user queries.
